# Fractional Technical Leadership

## C-Suite Expertise, Startup Flexibility

Access experienced technical leadership without the overhead of a full-time executive. Whether you need a Chief Scientist to validate your technology, a Technical Advisor to guide strategic decisions, or a Head of Engineering to build your team, I provide the expertise and leadership your company needs to scale.

## Leadership Roles

Guide your company's scientific strategy through research direction, experimental design, and validation processes. I manage peer review, develop grant strategies, communicate technical vision to boards and investors, and provide IP and patent guidance to protect your innovations.

Provide strategic guidance for critical technical decisions including technology stack selection, AI/ML implementation roadmaps, and technical due diligence for fundraising. I evaluate vendors and partnerships while developing comprehensive risk mitigation strategies.

### Fractional Head of Engineering
Build high-performing technical teams by establishing engineering culture, implementing proven development methodologies, and aligning product and engineering efforts. I design hiring strategies, and conduct technical interviews.
