I"Û<p><em>Finding the courage, dedication, and commitment to experience all I desire. To learn the languages, read the histories, write my thoughts, share my beliefs, make my music. To help push humanity forward, and explore science, art, life, community, culture, the world, the psyche, the transpersonal mystique.</em></p>

<p><em>To create, to build; to serve, to surrender.</em>
