            <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>This has been a piece I’ve wanted to construct for a while now. The motivation for writing this began under a tree in Hillsboro, OR as I wrestled with a life decision. I was processing whether to move back to Texas and enroll in my PhD, or to maintain the life I was beginning to build in Oregon. I recall having a few of my favorite things with me: a harmonica in the key of E, my journal, and a pencil. I’d carried this journal with me for a few years by then, always intending to cultivate the habit of dumping my thoughts, emotions, and ideas into it. There were a few primordial entries, but nothing of any permanence - the habit was uncultivated. While sitting under that tree I began to flip through the journal much like a Brownian particle, jotting down intellectual threads for future exploration. “What of community?”, “What of freedom?”, …, “On love”. Years have passed since this beautiful Oregon summer day. I decided to go to graduate school - a decision that has seeded many ripples in my life.</p>

<p>The initial impetus for “On love” was in regards to my romantic relationship at the time. I recall thinking about our relationship and the love we shared for one another. I was thinking about how it all works - using my experience to help me understand, and form a hypothesis. We met through a program we did at the University of Oregon doing a resume building exercise. It was immediately clear that we had a decent bit in common. I recall initially feeling unsure about the thought of “us”. Despite this, we continued to see each other, where we started to develop a more common language, share joy in the hobbies of one another - building trust and love along the way. While sitting under this tree, thinking through all of this, I recalled a bit of knowledge about synchronization.</p>
