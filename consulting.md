# Technical Consulting Services

## Transform Complex Challenges Into Breakthrough Solutions

With deep expertise spanning medical devices, wearables, Agentic AI, experimental design, and scientific acumen, I help businesses navigate the intersection of cutting-edge technology and practical implementation. My academic foundation combined with real-world experience delivers solutions that are both innovative and executable.

## Core Consulting Areas

### Medical Device Development
I provide guidance to companies through the complete medical device lifecycle from concept, to prototype, to MVP, to FDA submission. I have experience in regulatory strategy, clinical trial design, wearable sensor integration, and quality systems implementation to ensure your device meets all compliance requirements.

### Agentic AI Implementation
Harness the power of autonomous AI systems with strategic implementation that aligns with your business goals. I provide end-to-end support from AI strategy development and custom LLM implementation to autonomous agent deployment.

### Experimental Design & Analysis
Transform your data into actionable insights using rigorous scientific methodology. I design studies for maximum statistical power, guide experimental progress, construct data analysis pipelines, build predictive models, and create clear visualizations that ensure data informed decision-making.

### Project Management Excellence
Keep complex technical projects on track with proven methodologies. I help coordinate cross-functional teams, develop risk mitigation strategies, and establish clear stakeholder communication to ensure project success.

## Who I Work With

### Entrepreneurs & Startups
I partner with pre-seed to Series A companies that need technical validation for their innovations. Whether you're building AI-powered products or navigating complex regulatory requirements, I am able to meet you where you're at in your startup journey and provide the expertise to accelerate your path to market.

### Small Business Leaders
I help established businesses leverage technology for competitive advantage. From implementing AI solutions to providing fractional technical expertise, I enable organizations to access enterprise-level capabilities without the enterprise cost.

### Industry Professionals
I collaborate with R&D teams, product managers, and engineering leaders who need specialized expertise for critical projects. My strategic guidance helps technical teams overcome complex challenges and deliver exceptional results.

## My Approach

I typically begin every engagement with thorough discovery to understand your unique challenges. We then work together to develop a strategic roadmap with clear milestones, and I work hands-on alongside your team to ensure successful implementation. Throughout our engagement, I prioritize knowledge transfer so your team can maintain momentum independently.
