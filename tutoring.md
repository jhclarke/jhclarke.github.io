# STEM Tutoring Services

## Unlock Your Academic Potential

Transform challenging STEM subjects into opportunities for growth and discovery. With a PhD in physics, years of teaching experience, and proven success with direct mentorship, I provide personalized tutoring that goes beyond memorization to build deep understanding and lasting confidence.

## Subject Expertise

### Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
Master the technologies shaping our future through comprehensive instruction in utilizing state of the art AI tooling - neural networks, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and agents. I leave students with strong fundamentals and an advanced toolkit for practical implementation.

### Physics
Excel in physics - classical mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, biophysics, you name it. I provide expert preparation for all AP Physics levels and college courses, focusing on building problem-solving intuition and connecting concepts to real-world applications.

### Mathematics
Build a rock-solid foundation with comprehensive coverage of calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, statistics, and probability. I emphasize mathematical modeling and optimization techniques that apply across all STEM fields.

### General Sciences
Receive comprehensive support across scientific disciplines including chemistry, biology, and interdisciplinary STEM topics. I also guide students in research methodology and scientific writing to prepare for advanced academic work.

## Who I Help Succeed

### High School Students
I help students achieve top AP exam scores, build college readiness skills, develop winning science fair projects, and transform academic performance. My approach encourages students to prefer building deeper understanding rather than rote memorization.

### College Students
Navigate challenging undergraduate courses with expert support while developing research skills for meaningful projects. I guide students in building competitive graduate school applications and planning successful STEM career pathways. I help them make strategic connections to move their careers in the direction they desire.

### Lifelong Learners
Whether you're upskilling in AI and data science, transitioning to a technical career, exploring scientific concepts for personal interest, or seeking to better support your children's education, I provide tailored instruction that meets your specific goals.

## My Teaching Philosophy

I prioritize building conceptual understanding before equations - when you grasp the "why," the "how" follows naturally. Through active problem-solving and real-world connections, I adapt my approach to each student's learning style. Mistakes become opportunities in a supportive environment where curiosity drives learning.

## What Makes My Tutoring Different

My combination of published research, industry experience in AI and medical devices, and teaching expertise brings practical relevance to every concept. Students can expect to consistently improve by 1-2 letter grades, achieve high AP scores, and gain admission to top programs. Beyond subject mastery, I provide holistic support including study skills, test strategies, long-term academic planning, and personal growth. I put a lot of time and energy into making sure that the people I work with succeed.

## Session Structure

Start with a free 20-minute consultation where we discuss your goals and develop a customized learning plan. Regular sessions run 60-90 minutes on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, available virtually or in-person in the Austin area. I am able to provide custom problem sets, track progress through regular assessments, and maintain clear communication with parents for high school students.
